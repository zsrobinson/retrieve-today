# Retrieve Today

![A picture of two websites, with the left version being the original and the right version being the archived one](graphics/arrow.png)

A simple chrome extension to open the archived version of a website from the service [archive.today](https://archive.today/). Once you're on a page that you want to see the archive of, you're able to click the extension icon and the current tab will be replaced with the archived site. This respects your current history, meaning that you can just press the normal back button in chrome to go back to the original version of the site. If there isn't an archived version of the site available, archive.today will ask if you want to refine the URL, create an archive of the site, or search for the site on other archive services.
